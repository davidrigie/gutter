# Gutter — Roadmap to Great

Everything needed to take Gutter from functional prototype to a markdown editor people actually prefer. No fluff — just the gaps between where it is and where Bear/iA Writer/Obsidian are.

---

## Tier 1: Expected Basics (Users will notice these are missing)

### Find & Replace

- Cmd+F opens inline find bar at top of editor
- Cmd+Shift+F for replace mode
- Match case, whole word, regex toggles
- Highlight all matches in document with match count
- Enter/Shift+Enter to cycle through matches

### Quick Open

- Cmd+P opens fuzzy file finder (separate from command palette)
- Searches all files in workspace by name
- Recent files weighted higher in results
- Preview file on arrow-key hover, open on Enter

### Clipboard Image Paste

- Paste screenshot from clipboard directly into editor
- Auto-save image to `./assets/` folder next to the markdown file
- Insert markdown image link at cursor position
- Support drag & drop of image files onto editor too

### File Watcher

- Watch workspace directory for external changes
- Auto-refresh file tree when files are added/removed/renamed outside Gutter
- Prompt to reload if the currently open file is modified externally
- Use Tauri's `notify` or `fs::watch` on the Rust side

### Resizable Panels

- Drag handles on file tree and comments panel borders
- Persist widths across sessions (store in local config)
- Double-click handle to reset to default width
- Minimum widths so panels don't collapse to nothing

### Undo/Redo Indicators

- Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z already work via ProseMirror
- Add undo/redo state awareness to status bar or toolbar
- Disable save status flicker on undo back to clean state

## Tier 2: Polish That Makes It Feel Pro

### Document Outline

- Sidebar tab or panel showing heading structure (H1–H6)
- Click to scroll to heading
- Highlight current section as you scroll
- Collapsible hierarchy
- Could share space with file tree as a tab

### Typewriter / Focus Mode

- Pairs with existing zen mode
- Dim all paragraphs except the one being edited
- Optionally keep current line vertically centered
- Toggle via Cmd+Shift+T or command palette

### Drag & Drop in File Tree

- Drag files and folders to reorder / move between directories
- Visual drop indicator (line or highlight on target folder)
- Hold over collapsed folder to auto-expand
- Undo support for accidental moves

### Tab Improvements

- Drag to reorder tabs
- Middle-click to close
- Tab overflow: scroll or show dropdown for many tabs
- Pin tabs (pinned tabs are narrower, icon-only)

### Better Welcome Screen

- Show when no file is open instead of the static welcome doc
- Recent files list
- "Open File" and "Open Folder" buttons
- Keyboard shortcut cheatsheet
- App version

### Export

- Cmd+Shift+E or File > Export
- PDF export (via print-to-PDF or a rendering library)
- HTML export (standalone, styled)
- Copy as formatted text (paste into Google Docs, email)
- Export with or without comments

## Tier 3: Differentiators (What makes Gutter *Gutter*)

### Backlinks & Wiki Linking

- `[[filename]]` syntax to link between workspace documents
- Autocomplete file names as you type inside `[[`
- Backlinks panel: "These documents link to this one"
- Hover preview of linked document
- This turns Gutter from a markdown editor into a knowledge tool

### Frontmatter Support

- Parse YAML frontmatter block (title, tags, date, etc.)
- Render as a clean metadata bar above the document, not raw YAML
- Edit inline or via a structured form
- Use frontmatter title as tab/window title if present

### Version History

- Auto-snapshot on save (local `.gutter/history/` directory)
- Timeline view to browse past versions
- Diff view between any two versions
- Restore previous version

### Spell Check

- Squiggly underline on misspelled words
- Right-click to see suggestions
- Personal dictionary (add words)
- Support for multiple languages

### Comment Enhancements

- @mentions in comments (for multi-user future)
- Emoji reactions on comments
- Filter comments by resolved/open/author
- Comment anchors survive document edits (track by surrounding text, not just marks)
- Export comments as a standalone review document

## Infrastructure / DX

### Settings File

- `~/.gutter/config.json` or workspace `.gutter/settings.json`
- Font, theme, panel widths, default author name, auto-save interval
- Settings UI accessible from command palette

### Performance

- Debounce file tree refresh on rapid filesystem changes
