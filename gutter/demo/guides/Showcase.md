# The Marginal Cost of Knowledge

> "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." — Socrates

Every organization eventually hits the same wall: <mark>knowledge lives in people's heads, not in systems</mark><sup>[c1]</sup>. The cost isn't dramatic — it's **incremental**. Each small friction compounds until teams spend more time *searching* for information than *creating* it.

/

The total cost can be modeled as:

$$
C_{total} = C_{create} + C_{store} + C_{retrieve} + C_{decay}
$$

Where $C_{decay}$ is almost always the <mark>dominant and most overlooked term</mark><sup>[c2]</sup>. See [[Research Notes]] for real-world examples.

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Proximity** | Knowledge lives next to the work |
| **Low friction** | Capturing is faster than forgetting |
| **Linked** | Ideas connect to related context |
| **Commentable** | Others can react without rewriting |
