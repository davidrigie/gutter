# Writing Demo

<mark>This file demonstrates Gutter's rich text formatting </mark><sup>[c2]</sup><mark>capabilities.</mark><sup>[c3]</sup>

## Text Formatting

You can write in **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`. You can also combine them: ***bold italic***, `**bold code**`, and ~~*strikethrough italic*~~.

## Lists

### Unordered

- First item
- Second item with a longer description that wraps across multiple lines to show how the editor handles paragraph-level content inside list items
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
    - Deeply nested
- Third item

### Ordered

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
4. Sub-step A
5. Sub-step B

## Blockquotes

> "The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better."
> 
> — Stephen King

> **Tip:** You can nest blockquotes and include formatting inside them.
> 
> > This is a nested blockquote with `code` and **bold**.
