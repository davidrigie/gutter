# Jan 15 — Project Kickoff

Started building Gutter today. Set up the Tauri + React + TipTap stack.

## What I Did

- Scaffolded the project with `create-tauri-app`
- Configured TipTap with StarterKit, code blocks, and custom extensions
- Built the three-file comment model prototype
- Set up Zustand stores for editor and comment state

## Key Decision

Went with **TipTap 3** over ProseMirror directly. The extension API saves a ton of boilerplate, and the React integration is solid.

> The hardest part was getting the markdown round-trip right. `serialize(parse(md))` needs to produce nearly identical output.

## Tomorrow

- Build the file tree component
- Add tab support
- Start on the comment UI
