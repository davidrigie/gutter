# Jan 20 — Product Review

Met with the team to review progress. See [[Meeting Notes]] for full notes.

## Highlights

- Editor core is stable and fast (< 200ms load time)
- Comment system working end-to-end
- File tree + tabs shipped

## Feedback

Sarah loved the comment model. Mike wants better keyboard shortcuts documentation — created [[Keyboard Shortcuts]] guide.

## Blockers

None right now. The stack is performing well.

## Next Steps

1. Polish the UI (resizable panels, better themes)
2. Add find & replace
3. Start thinking about collaboration — see [[Research Notes]]
