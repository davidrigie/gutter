## Reflections

> Building with Tauri + React is a joy. The IPC boundary is clean, Rust handles all the file system operations, and the frontend stays focused on UI.

The <mark>three-file comment model</mark><sup>[c1]</sup> continues to prove itself. It's portable, human-readable, and works with any git workflow.

## What's Next

- Collaboration via CRDTs (see [[Research Notes]])
- Mobile companion app
- Plugin API (see [[Gutter Roadmap]])
