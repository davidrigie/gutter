> **[c1]** on "local-first architecture"

**James Okafor** — Mar 25, 2025 3:15 AM
Should we define what "local-first" means more precisely here? The Ink & Switch definition has 7 properties — we only satisfy 5 of them right now.

Good point. I've linked to the full paper in the appendix. For this doc, I think the plain-language version is fine — the audience is engineering leadership, not academics.

> **[c2]** on "especially significant for our sync engine"

**Maya Patel** — Mar 26, 2025 2:00 AM
The 18k ops/s number is from our benchmarks on M2. Should we include numbers for lower-end hardware too? Our Windows users on spinning disks might see very different results.

> **[c3]** on "last-writer-wins register"

LWW at field level feels too coarse for rich text. What happens when two people bold different words in the same paragraph?

**Sarah Chen** — Mar 26, 2025 6:45 AM
That's handled by the Peritext layer, not LWW. LWW only kicks in for scalar fields like title and metadata. Text content goes through character-level CRDT merge. I'll clarify this in section 2.3.

> **[c4]** on "storage overhead"

**James Okafor** — Mar 27, 2025 1:00 AM
We should add a note about compaction. After running Automerge's compaction pass, the overhead drops to ~15% for large documents. Without compaction the history grows unbounded.

> **[c5]** on "Design a clear conflict resolution UI"

**Ava Kim** — Mar 27, 2025 9:00 AM
I've started wireframes for this. The inline diff approach from Google Docs feels too busy — I'm leaning toward a side-by-side panel that only appears when conflicts exist. Will share mocks next week.

**Tomás Rivera** — Mar 27, 2025 9:45 AM
Side-by-side sounds great. Can we also add a "just pick the latest" button for people who don't want to think about it?
